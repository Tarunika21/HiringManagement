# HiringManagement

This project introduces an innovative approach to streamline the resume screening process using Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
With the increasing volume of job applications from platforms like LinkedIn and naukri.com, efficiently identifying strong candidates is challenging. 
After employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization and stopword removal, Word2Vec captures word relationships. Subsequently, K-Means generates clusters, each representing specific skills like technical, non-technical, and soft skills. 
This AI-driven approach significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of resume screening, benefiting both job seekers and recruiters.
